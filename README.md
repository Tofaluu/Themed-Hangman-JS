My [original python hangman game](https://github.com/Tofaluu/Themed-Hangman.git) but now playable on a browser (using JavaScript)!

**Hangman** is a single-player game where you compete against the computer to guess a secret word before time runs out.

### 👉 [Click Here to Play in Browser](https://tofaluu.github.io/themed-hangman-game/)

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Choose a Theme:** Select one of six unique themes to start the game.
2. **Guess Letters:** Attempt to decipher the phrase one letter at a time.
3. **Win or Lose:**
   * **Correct Guess:** Fills in the blanks.
   * **Wrong Guess:** Adds a part to the "Hangman" figure.
   * **Game Over:** If the figure is completed, you lose!

## 🏆 Scoring
* **1 Point** for every word successfully guessed.
* If you win, the game immediately generates a new word from the same theme so you can keep your streak alive.
* Your final score is displayed when the game ends.

Have fun and keep hanging on!
